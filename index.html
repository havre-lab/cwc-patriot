                    Hello, we are the Patriots of the American Colonies. We started due to the
                    common goal to overthrow the British Tyrants. We want to give freedom
                    the overgoverning monarchy to the 13 colonies, 
                    and you, if you join us.
                
                <h1>What do we do?</h1>
                <p class="text">
                    We hold protests against the Intoleratable Acts, and the British Monarchy 
                    in general. We do this both physically and digitally, here on our website. Our
                    website contains information, our poster, our podcast, and more information
                    about us and our mission.
                </p>
                <h1>Our Leaders</h1>
                <p class="text">
                    <ul>
                        <li>George Washington</li>
                        <li>Thomas Jefferson</li>
                        <li>John Adams</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h1>Why should you join?</h1>
                <p class="text">
                    The British have imposed unfair laws, taxes, and denied us rightful land. 
                    To please others, we can not stand for this. We fought for this land, and now the
                     British are denying this? We will not take this. We must fight for freedom, unite 
                     under the colonies, and receive protection against the British, and more importantly, 
                     our rightful land and freedom. Unite under our shared goal, and we shall overthrow the British.
                      If you do not want to join the fight for our goals of freedom outwardly, say if you live in a 
                      very loyalist occupied area, and do not want to be ridiculed by your neighbours, you may donate
                       us money at the following site:
